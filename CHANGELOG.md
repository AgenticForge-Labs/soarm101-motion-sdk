# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Replaced the LeRobot runtime plan with direct official Feetech SDK control.
- Added calibration compatibility, stock-gripper tooling, FK, bounded IK, smooth joint and linear motion, diagnostics, CLI workflows, and simulation.
- Hardened torque enable by latching measured positions before energizing the servos.
- Unified blocking and nonblocking motion cancellation and made software stop wait for the active motion task to terminate.
- Added complete command-rate trajectory prevalidation, joint speed/acceleration checks, and feedback-based completion timeouts.
- Fixed anti-parallel camera and approach-axis IK constraints.
- Made calibration transactional with EEPROM rollback on failure or interruption.
