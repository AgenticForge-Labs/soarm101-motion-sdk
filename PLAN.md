# Development plan

Robo Director is the primary source of cross-repository integration requirements. The motion SDK remains authoritative for hardware, calibration, kinematics, planning, and safety; Studio and Puppeteer own the adapters that expose those abilities to Director.

## Implemented motion foundation

- [x] Direct official Feetech SDK hardware backend.
- [x] STS3215 IDs, register table, model verification, and synchronized commands.
- [x] Native and LeRobot-compatible calibration storage/discovery with content-addressed
  calibration IDs, immutable history, and motion-artifact provenance.
- [x] Five-joint arm and `SO101Gripper` tool separation.
- [x] FK, bounded IK, minimum-jerk joint movement, and preplanned linear movement.
- [x] Blocking and nonblocking motion handles with unified cancellation.
- [x] Torque-safe enable, trajectory validation, feedback completion, timeouts, diagnostics, CLI, and simulation.
- [x] PySide6 Setup/Control/Teach workspaces with shared follower/leader GUI
  mechanical-stop calibration.
- [x] Persistent Home/Rest pose library and calibrated joint-control ranges.
- [x] Independent read-only leader/controller connection and selectable teaching source.
- [x] Named taught points captured from follower or leader and replayed as joint or linear moves.
- [x] Immutable 50 Hz trajectory recording with gripper and optional effort/current diagnostics.
- [x] Validated trajectory replay with safe pre-roll to the recorded start pose.
- [x] Trajectory Editor v1: timeline, scrub, crop selection, speed scaling, Save As, and replay.
- [x] Persistent sequence editor/runner with point, Home/Rest, gripper, wait, trajectory,
  and semantic primitive steps plus step execution, repeat, speed scaling, pause/resume,
  cancellation, and STOP/HOLD integration.
- [x] Guarded 50 Hz joint streaming and leader-to-follower teleoperation in relative or
  absolute calibrated modes, with optional gripper mirroring.
- [x] Advanced non-destructive trajectory editing: smoothing, delete/splice, holds,
  keyframes, markers, repeated clips, and semantic motion primitives.

## Director ecosystem integration 0.2

- [x] Add `.agenticforge/integration-manifest.json` and `INTEGRATION.md`.
- [x] Publish stable units, base-frame, resource, stop-classification, and TCP-ownership metadata.
- [x] Define this SDK as a library consumed by Studio and Puppeteer rather than a Director service.
- [x] Expose a shared `motion-platform:<id>` resource convention.
- [x] Document nonblocking handle and cancellation requirements for consumer adapters.
- [x] Add integration metadata tests.
- [ ] Validate the Studio SO-ARM motion-platform plugin in simulation.
- [ ] Validate the Puppeteer named-gesture embodiment in simulation.
- [ ] Pass the Director cross-repository simulated-show suite.

## Physical validation gate

- [ ] Run port discovery and six-motor model check on the user's arm.
- [ ] Import or perform calibration and verify all directions.
- [ ] Run the conservative 2° CLI smoke test on each joint with no payload and verify
  physical direction before Cartesian motion.
- [ ] Validate stop, completion timeout, and torque-safe enable on hardware.
- [ ] Validate FK against measured TCP positions.
- [ ] Validate low-speed linear paths and tune tolerances.
- [ ] Validate guarded leader-to-follower streaming at low speed, including STOP,
  leader-readout loss, gripper mirroring, and stream safety trips.
- [ ] Validate sequence execution and edited motion primitives on hardware.
- [ ] Tag the first hardware-validated alpha release.

## Later

- [ ] Parallel gripper implementation.
- [ ] Tool assemblies with camera and gripper TCPs.
- [ ] Optional collision geometry and self-collision checks.
